# Python dictionary to map the activity types and the important columns to conserve in a dataframe

white_list_mapping = {
    "__doc__": """
    This dictionary maps the most common Global Protocol for Community-Scale Greenhouse Gas Emission Inventories (GPC) and the columns of interest to conserve in a dataframe. It is possible, that not all columns are present in the dataset.
    Each column name has a description of what kind of data falls into that respective column, the data type, and examples of the data.

    Instructions for the LLM:
    - Names in datasets may not match these names below exactly but can be identified by their descriptions or examples.
    - Focus on identifying semantically similar terms, synonyms, or variations in dataset names.
    - The column names in this dictionary represent common terms. If a dataset uses different terminology for a concept (e.g., 'energy source' instead of 'energy type'), map accordingly.

    Important:
    If you are unsure about the mapping of the columns and which ones to delete, do not delete any columns.
    
    Examples:
    - example1: a dataset from Mendoza city has the following list of input columns ['Period', 'Operator', 'Registration Number', 'Brand/Flag', 'Deregistration Date', 'Tax ID', 'Business Type', 'Address', 'Locality', 'Province', 'Product', 'Marketing/Distribution Channel', 'Price without Taxes', 'Price with Taxes', 'Volume', 'Pump Price', 'No Movements', 'Exempt', 'Price without taxes', 'Price with taxes', 'Pump price'], 
    but the columns to conserve are ['Period', 'Operator', 'Address', 'Province', 'Product', 'Marketing/Distribution Channel', 'Volume']
    - example2: a dataset from UEA has the following list of input columns ['STRUCTURE', 'STRUCTURE_ID', 'STRUCTURE_NAME', 'ACTION', 'REF_AREA', 'Reference area', 'FREQ', 'Frequency of observation', 'TIME_PERIOD', 'Time period', 'MEASURE', 'Measure', 'UNIT_MEASURE', 'Unit of measure', 'SOURCE_DETAIL', 'Source', 'COAL_PRODUCT', 'Coal Product', 'OG_PRODUCT', 'Oil and Gas Product Types', 'OG_SECTOR', 'Oil and Gas Variables', 'NG_SECTOR', 'Natural Gas Variables', 'NL_SECTOR', 'Natural Gas Liquids Variables', 'OG_COAL', 'Coal Variables', 'CO_INPUT', 'Refineries Input Type', 'OBS_VALUE', 'Observation value', 'OBS_STATUS', 'Observation status', 'UNIT_MULT', 'Unit multiplier', 'OBS_COMMENT', 'Footnotes', 'DECIMALS', 'Decimals'],
    but the columns to conserve are ['STRUCTURE_NAME', 'REF_AREA', 'Reference area', 'Frequency of observation', 'Unit of measure', 'TIME_PERIOD', 'Source', 'Oil and Gas Product Types', 'OBS_VALUE']
    
    The names given in this dictionary are indicative and can be changed according to the specific dataset.
