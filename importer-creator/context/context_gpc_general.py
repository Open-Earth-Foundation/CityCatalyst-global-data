The following defines the general terms used in the Greenhouse Gas Protocol for Cities (GPC). 

- Activity data is a quantitative measure of a level of activity that results in GHG emissions taking place during a given period of time (e.g., volume of gas used, kilometers driven, tonnes of solid waste sent to landfill, etc.).
- An emission factor is a measure of the mass of GHG emissions relative to a unit of activity. For example, estimating CO2 emissions from the use of electricity involves multiplying data on kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity used by the emission factor (kgCO2/kWh) for electricity, which will depend on the technology and type of fuel used to generate the electricity
