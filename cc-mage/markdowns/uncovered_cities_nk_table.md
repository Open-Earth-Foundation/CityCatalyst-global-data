**About this query:**

Taking into account the cities not covered for the main BR data sources in the database, it was checked if these same cities were in the "nk_br" table, which corresponds to the table containing the points of activities that do occur in the city.

Which means that an activity is happening in the city but we don't have the data in our db.
