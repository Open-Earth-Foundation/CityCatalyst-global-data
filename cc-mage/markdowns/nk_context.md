### Dataset context
Different datasets have been considered to verify whether an activity is taking place or not in a pilot city in Brazil.
These datasets are mainly global open datasets with facility locations.

The datasets are as follows:

1. Oil and Gas (I.8.1): from Oil and Gas Infrastructure Mapping [OGIM](https://zenodo.org/records/7922117) database
2. Coal mining (I.7.1): from Global Coal Mine Tracker [GCMT](https://globalenergymonitor.org/projects/global-coal-mine-tracker/)
3. Power Plants in BR (I.4.1): Agência Nacional de Energia Elétrica [ANEEL](https://dados.gov.br/dados/organizacoes/visualizar/agencia-nacional-de-energia-eletrica)
4. Aviation (II.4.3): Airpotrs location worldwide [OurAirports](https://ourairports.com/world.html)

Some sub-sectors cannot be verified by this method for data availability, such as solid waste, wastewater, AFOLU subsectors and IPPU industries.
